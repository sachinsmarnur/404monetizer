# Account Deletion Guide

## Overview
The account deletion functionality has been completely rebuilt to ensure **complete data deletion** from the database when a user deletes their account. This implementation follows best practices for data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA) and ensures no orphaned data remains.

## ‚úÖ What Gets Deleted

When a user deletes their account, the following data is **permanently removed**:

### 1. **User Account**
- User profile information (name, email, password)
- User preferences and settings
- Plan information
- Email notification settings

### 2. **404 Pages**
- All created 404 pages
- Page configurations and settings
- Custom CSS and JavaScript
- Social links and monetization features
- Page themes and styling

### 3. **Analytics Data**
- All analytics records for user's pages
- Page view counts and conversion data
- Revenue tracking information
- Device type, country, and referrer data
- Historical analytics data (all dates)

### 4. **Analytics Events**
- Detailed event tracking data
- User interaction events
- Conversion tracking events
- Custom event data and metadata

### 5. **Collected Emails**
- All email addresses collected through user's pages
- Email collection source information
- Lead generation data

### 6. **Associated Configurations**
- Monetization settings
- AdSense configurations
- Affiliate link setups
- Lead magnet configurations
- All custom monetization features

## üîí Technical Implementation

### Database Transaction Safety
```sql
-- Uses MySQL transactions to ensure atomicity
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Delete child records first (respects foreign key constraints)
DELETE FROM collected_emails WHERE page_id IN (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?);
DELETE FROM analytics_events WHERE page_id IN (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?);
DELETE FROM analytics WHERE page_id IN (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?);
DELETE FROM analytics WHERE user_id = ?;
DELETE FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?;
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?;
COMMIT;
```

### Foreign Key Constraints
The database schema includes proper CASCADE DELETE constraints:
```sql
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
FOREIGN KEY (page_id) REFERENCES pages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### Deletion Order
1. **Collected Emails** (linked to pages)
2. **Analytics Events** (linked to pages) 
3. **Analytics Data** (linked to both pages and user)
4. **Pages** (linked to user)
5. **User Account** (root record)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Authentication Required
- Valid JWT token required
- User can only delete their own account
- No admin override capabilities

### Audit Logging
```javascript
console.log(`Starting account deletion for user ID: ${userId}`);
console.log(`Deleted ${emailsResult.affectedRows} collected emails`);
console.log(`Deleted ${eventsResult.affectedRows} analytics events`);
console.log(`Deleted ${analyticsPageResult.affectedRows} analytics records by page`);
console.log(`Deleted ${analyticsUserResult.affectedRows} analytics records by user`);
console.log(`Deleted ${pagesResult.affectedRows} pages`);
console.log(`Successfully deleted user account ID: ${userId}`);
```

### Transaction Rollback
- If any deletion fails, entire transaction is rolled back
- Database remains in consistent state
- User gets clear error message

## üö® User Experience

### Warning Dialog
The settings page shows a comprehensive warning with:
- Clear list of what will be deleted
- Emphasis on irreversible action
- Warning about embedded pages stopping work
- Styled as "Danger Zone" with destructive colors

### Confirmation Process
1. User clicks "Delete Account" button
2. Modal dialog appears with detailed warning
3. User must explicitly confirm by clicking "Delete Everything"
4. Loading state during deletion process
5. Success message and automatic logout
6. Redirect to homepage

## üìã Implementation Files

### Core API Route
- **`src/app/api/user/route.ts`** - Main deletion logic with transaction handling

### Database Schema
- **`src/db/schema.sql`** - Updated with CASCADE constraints
- **`src/db/migration_cascade_constraints.sql`** - Migration for existing databases

### Frontend Components
- **`src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`** - Enhanced deletion UI with warnings

## üîß Database Migration

For existing databases, run the migration script:
```sql
-- Run this to update existing databases
source src/db/migration_cascade_constraints.sql;
```

This adds proper CASCADE DELETE constraints to existing analytics tables.

## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

To verify the deletion works correctly:

1. **Create Test Data**
   - Create user account
   - Create 404 pages
   - Generate some analytics data
   - Collect some emails

2. **Verify Data Exists**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id = ?;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM analytics WHERE user_id = ?;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collected_emails WHERE page_id IN (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?);
   ```

3. **Perform Deletion**
   - Go to Settings page
   - Click "Delete Account"
   - Confirm deletion

4. **Verify Complete Deletion**
   ```sql
   -- All should return 0
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id = ?;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM analytics WHERE user_id = ?;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM analytics_events WHERE page_id IN (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?);
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collected_emails WHERE page_id IN (SELECT id FROM pages WHERE user_id = ?);
   ```

## üîç Monitoring

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account and all associated data deleted successfully",
  "deletedData": {
    "user": 1,
    "pages": 3,
    "emails": 15,
    "events": 42,
    "analytics": 28
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
- Authentication errors (401)
- User not found (404)
- Database transaction errors (500)
- Clear error messages for debugging

## üìä Compliance

This implementation ensures compliance with:
- **GDPR** - Right to be forgotten (Article 17)
- **CCPA** - Right to deletion
- **Data minimization** principles
- **Privacy by design** requirements

## üöÄ Production Deployment

1. **Backup Database** before deploying
2. **Run migration script** on production database
3. **Test deletion** on staging environment first
4. **Monitor logs** for any issues
5. **Verify CASCADE constraints** are working

The implementation is now **production-ready** and ensures complete, secure deletion of all user-associated data.
